# landing_page

10.03.2022.


Today after finishing all the exercises in the flexbox folder i started the project of building my own webpage without any help beside googling the problems that i encounter.

I will update the readme file everytime i encounter a roadblock.

Managed to pull a website together but not quite happy with the outcome, had some problems with flexbox and aligning some items correctly. Will progress through the course and then revisit the project at a later time, I want to make the landing page a bit more responsive and fix the flexbox. 

Project resembles the landing page exercise but I'm not that happy with the way i used some of the code.
